      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="G:\Homework\Responsive-Portfolio\Corey.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Establishing a not so secret headquarters in the Ukrainian Village neighborhood on Chicago's west side, Corey embarked on his journey to become a Whole Stack Developer. Few would remain his confidants while he embarked on his 6-month journey, he would himself tend to injuries and no other was available in offerings of sage advice!</p>

      <p>Corey became an urban legend, a cautionary tale that sent shivers through the city's underworld. This isolated developer found a friend in anyone who would approve of his methods, few appreciated the results of his nightly study ritual. Corey's portfolio grew to include a host of bizarre websites that were limited in functionality. As his enemies increased, help arrived in the form of the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp.</p>
